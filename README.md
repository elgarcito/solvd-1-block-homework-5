Extend your previous homework with next features:
* Add 5 collections to the hierarchy.
* Create custom LinkedList with generic.

### Solution
* The five collections are:
1. electricProductArrayList in ElectricProduct class.
2. employeeList in Employee class.
3. gardenProductHashSetList in GardenProduct.
4. householdItemArrayList in HouseHoldItem class.
5. resumedEmployeeInformationList in Employee class.

All of these Lists only accept add a product operation.
If you need access to the list, using the static method getCopy... 
in each Class mentioned (Employee, HouseHoldItem, GardenProduct and ElectricProduct) 
you get a copy of this list.
This protects the modification of the original list.
